In this version, v251021

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed a bug at Farmbot II;
● Added Mining bot (Farm range is available for mining bot too) [Also works for GF servers too];
● Removed '< ^ > v' buttons for teleporting (Added hotkeys instead: left, up, down, right);
● Fixed STMod for Wonder2.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
