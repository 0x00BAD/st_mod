In this version, v081221

Those are the new improvements:


● Fixed 'Stack function';
● Changes at Fishbot tab:
 -> Removed 'Buy bait from X slot' > now will auto buy the bait depending of what you've chose;
● Fixed minor issues.


Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
