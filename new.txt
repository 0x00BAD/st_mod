In this version, v110122

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed for Pservers:
 --> Metin2SG
 --> Mester2
● Added at Fishbot:
 --> 'Skip animation' > it is now changeable.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
