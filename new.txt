Update v150922

Those are the new improvements:

● Remade from scratch Farmbot III, now will work way smoother, also added 'Kill mobs' function to it;
Notice: In order to use it, you have to delete old routes, now routes are using a different format.
Notice 2: In order to farm 'Special' or 'Custom' bosses/mobs (Using 'Kill bosses' function), which are not detected by default by the bot, you have to Open 'Metin & Boss detector', right click on the mob/boss and click on 'Add boss', if everything is okay, a message will show up in chat.
● Fixed some small issues.
