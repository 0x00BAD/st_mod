In this version, v180221

Those are the new improvements:
- Added a function for searching servers in the (not) / working list;
- Fixed bugs;
- Made a launcher for STMod (You should run only that launcher for better undetection).

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
