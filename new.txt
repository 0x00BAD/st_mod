In this version, v161121

Those are the new improvements:

● Added method 4 (Available only for servers which are using python22);
● Fixed STMod for Metin2Tim;
● Few issues got fixed.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
