Update v310822

Those are the new improvements:

● Added a new Injection method (If STMod doesn't inject with the normal injection, check that box, may fix your issue);
● At fishbot tab added a 'Fishing delay' info message, to check how the delay should be, based on your fishing rod;
● Fixed some bugs.
