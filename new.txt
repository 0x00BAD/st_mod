In this version, v290121

Those are the new improvements:
- Premium users can use ST Mod at once for multiple servers (Going to 'Switch server' won't close active clients so you can play up to 12 servers at once.);
- Fixed a bug where free users when clicked on 'Injector' menu, after one click it disables itself.

In this version, v290121_rev2

Those are the new improvements:
- Added new button on the menu (Help > ST Mod Fix) >> This is for users that can't manage to inject ST Mod.

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
