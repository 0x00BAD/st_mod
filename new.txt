In this version, v021121_rev2

Those are the new improvements:

● Added 'Farmbot Fix' (Available for Farmbot I only);
● When your character dies, and you have 'Restart' function on, at restart will auto use the first 5 slots of your inventory and the 44th one (thinking as being a pet);
● Added a second method to Move your items into storage;
● Added Checkboxes for every On / Off functions instead of those buttons (some servers couldn't load those images);
● Fixed other things.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
