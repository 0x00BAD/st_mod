In this version, v020721

Those are the new improvements:
- Improved autologin function (Now works for Calliope);
- Added a new function (Under methods injection, you'll find now 'Patcher' option, this is similar to GF method);
- Fixed some issues.

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
