In this version, v121121

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed Farmbot III (Now 'Walking' method is available too);
● Fixed 'Map Teleport';
● Fixed the bug where if stmod was opened you cannot throw items from inventory;
● Fixed the bug where you cannot send / receive PM's;
● Added 'Strong body' function (only you can see it, also this is useful because chars or other mobs / bosses cannot throw you);
● Fixed minor issues.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
