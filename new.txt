Update v160123

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:
	● Remade entire Fishing bot logic (rewrote it from scratch), now will work way smoother;
	● Added config for 'EdenM2' at import settings;
	● Now at farming bot (farm in range option) when the bot doesn't see any entity to attack, will go back to the initial position.
