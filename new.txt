In this version, v241121

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed mining bot for Celestial World 2;
● Fixed the bug where fishbot was spamming 'fishing rod is ready to upgrade';
● Now the mod will auto read the right values for skills cooldown.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
