In this version, v101221

Those are the new improvements:

● Added Hotkeys;
● Added '?' buttons instead of '+';
● Fixed a bug at retrieving the right value at skills cooltime;
● Fixed some other small issues.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
