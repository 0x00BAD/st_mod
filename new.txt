In this version, v090521

Those are the new improvements:
- Replaced DaRealFreak's fishbot with Kamer's fishbot (more simple);
- Added Switchbot II;
- Added a new function: 'Attack as ninja' (you'll attack a little bit faster, eg. being an warrior + antifly) [Damage hacks are not be compatible with this!];
- Were made some improvements;
- Bugs fixed.

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
