Update v080423

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:
 ● Fixed 'Beep when PM recieved' & 'Reply bot' for Rubinum2;
 ● At 'Inventory' tab added 'Item seller/destroyer' function (Using it, the bot will auto sell [you can also use this without any shop opened if the server accepts this 'selling' packet] / destroy selected items);
 ● Fixed some bugs.

We've created also a Telegram server, feel free to join it from here: https://t.me/xstmod
