Update v210423

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:
● Added auto client restart & login if client crashed (Pservers only);
● Improved 'Route farming' logic;
● Once injected (if 'Load STMod' in-game button is shown), in-game STMod window will auto show-up in ~30 seconds;
● Beep sound can be customized now (You can change it from STMod folder > Resources > Sounds || Make sure the extension of the beep file is .wav -> beep.wav);
● Fixed arabic text for GF servers;
● STMod will now save & load Farming bot state (useful if client restarted and keeping the last farming state);
● Fixed STMod for Revenant2.
