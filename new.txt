In this version, v301221

Those are the new improvements:

● Added at Shop manager tab:
-> 'Fix sell function' > this is useful for servers which modified the base selling function;
-> Added 'Destroy' items function (from slot x to y);
● Fixed other small issues.


Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
