In this version, v200222

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed STMod for Gameforge servers (Now you don't have to login firstly in order to load STMod. After the metin2 client started, just focus on it and press Insert);
● Fixed a bug when trying to load OpenBot (while trying to inject it, it was giving an error).
