In this version, v250121

Those are the new improvements:
- Fixed dependecy error;
- Fixed starting clients with other extensions (now you can open clients as '.exe' even if they are '.txt';
- Some bug fixes.


NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
