In this version, v231221

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed a bug where STMod was not loaded into GF servers;
● Now the non-premium users can use:
  > Waithack;
  > x7 attack;

● Some other small issues got fixed.


Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
