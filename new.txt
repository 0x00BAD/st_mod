In this version, v291221

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed Levelbot;
● Fixed some UI bugs;
● Added at Shop manager tab:
-> Buy & sell (also option to drop / destroy item>> it will auto check if server has 'Destroy' function) > This function should be useful when buying weapons from NPC with average damage / skill damage;
-> Now at item user you will be allowed to insert a delay up to 6 characters (0.0001);
● Fixed other small issues.


Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
