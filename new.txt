In this version, v091121

Those are the new improvements:

● Added quick add Skill points (+17);
● Fixed fishbot bugs (if 'buy bait' was checked, the client froze, and now the bait it will use first will be the minnow);
● Made some custom buttons (for '?');
● Removed some unnecesary code;
● Bug fixes.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
