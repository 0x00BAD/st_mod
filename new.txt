In this version, v290121

Those are the new improvements:
- Premium users can use ST Mod at once for multiple servers (Going to 'Switch server' won't close active clients so you can play up to 12 servers at once.);
- Fixed a bug where free users when clicked on 'Injector' menu, after one click it disables itself.

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
