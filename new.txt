In this version, v121021

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed not showing STMod window on some Pservers;
● Added support for 'A', 'S', 'D' + 'Shift' combination at speedhack.


Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
