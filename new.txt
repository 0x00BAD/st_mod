In this version, v200721

Those are the new improvements:
- Fixed 'Use Horse' bug at first Farmbot from the list (iPush) -->> Thanks to: seedlord;
- Fixed 'Attacking' issues at both farmbots: iPush & MH + WH;
- Fixed saving settings at Zahon_Mod.

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
