Update v090323

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:

● Fixed Fishbot for GF Servers where if you'd change Map, it stopped working (if still doesn't start once you press on the start button, start fishing manually);
● Added at GF energy bot a new function: 'Fill inventory' (the bot will fill the inventory with selected items until your inventory has few empty slots);
● STMod will now save & load Pickup speed;
● Fixed some other small issues.
