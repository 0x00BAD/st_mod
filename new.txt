In this version, v020822

Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed a bug where if 'Use horse' function was enabled, and character got kicked or dead, the bot stopped using it;
● Fixed 'Metin & Boss detector' function;
● Now, when using skills, STMod will check if the skill is still active, if yes, then it won't deactivate it;
● Fixed some small issues.
