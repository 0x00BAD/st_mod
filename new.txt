Update v220523

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:
● Fixed STMod for Azora2;
● The bot will randomize now the mining time with -+ 2 sec;
● At Spambot tab -> Auto-reply, added a new function: 'Repeat previous message', using this, the bot will auto respond to the sender with its message (only if the message recieved doesn't exists on your reply list), as example: sender sends you a message with 'hi, are you here?', the bot will answer with 'hi, are you here?';
● Minor bugfixes.

We've created also a Telegram server, feel free to join it from here: https://t.me/xstmod
