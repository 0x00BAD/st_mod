In this version, v080221

Those are the new improvements:
- Fixed a bug at Multimod > Farmbot (Didn't attack stones);
- Improved fishbot (If you don't have bait, it will autobuy it, make sure you select the Fisherman NPC, st mod will open the shop automatically);
- Added autologin (Click on 'Autologin' button only after you logged in);
- Bugs fixed.

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
