In this version, v280121

Those are the new improvements:
- Disabled function 'copy launcher';
- Improved multimod for gf servers (including shop scanner);
- Added a new function (Hide / Show);
- Now, if clients will crash, it will autodetect (if client1 crashed, stop button will not be visible.) useful so as not to confuse you;
- Enabled function 'Switch server' (File > Settings > Switch server) >> Now you do not have to close ST Mod to switch to another server;
- Bug fixes.

NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
