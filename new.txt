In this version, v120720

Those are the new improvements:

- randomized title (for memory detection inside of protected clients)
- added a tray menu, you can control your clients from there (minimized ST Mod)
- disabled profile system (at the moment add a new server isn't a necessary function, instead of adding a new server, just copy-paste ST Mod into the metin2 folder configure it there)
- fixed some bugs.
