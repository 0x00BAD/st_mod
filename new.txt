Update v211222

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:
	● Remade the licencing system ->
		- You'll now need an account in order to use STMod (You can create it directly from STMod);
		- You only have to login once;
		- The users that have their licence still active, you'll have to create a ticket with your old payment info (Email, key, date of purchase etc) and we will port your old licence to the new one;
		- The prices are slightly changed;
		- Now, if you'll use 'Shoppy.gg' as payment method, once the payment is done, you'll recieve your key on your Email (no need to wait for us), also there are only 3 packages available -> 10 days, 30 days, 60 days;
		- There are 100 coupons ( `STMod10` ) 10% off; 
	● Fixed STMod for Rubinum ->
		- Use skill;
		- Drop-down menus;
		- Farmbot;
	● Now, at Import settings if you already have a config for a specific server it will prompt you that if you want to overwrite the existing config (maybe your current config is old);
	● Fixed STMod free version for GF servers;
	● Fixed the bug where if you clicked on random positions in game, and had the option 'Auto refresh map' from Map teleport, will teleported you randomly;
	● Fixed some other issues.
