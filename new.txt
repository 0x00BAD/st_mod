Update v220323

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:

● Fixed STMod for GGMT2 (Fixed crashes);
● Added auto-fix STMod for Legend of Metin2 (removed the fix from main STMod window, now the bot will auto-fix it on this server);
● Fixed STMod for Attomey2 (Use config from import settings);
● Added a new function near Pickup > "Pickup only after breaking an entity".
(This way, STMod won't spam everytime the pickup function, also when this function is used, will only pickup items when a metin / boss etc was killed)
Notice: This function will only be available when Farmbot is on!
  
  
Notice: Starting from 17 March until 20 April, using promo code: STMOD30 you'll get 30% Discount.
