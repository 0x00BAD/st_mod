In this version, v090122

Those are the new improvements:

● Made a new plugin > Community scripts (everyone can send their scripts and everybody can use them);
● Added at General tab:
 --> Use red elixir;
 --> Use blue elixir;
 --> Load community scripts;
● Added at Farming tab:
 --> Remade 'Metin / boss detector' > now you can also select which boss you want to detect (checking 'Custom bosses');
● Fixed bugs.

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
