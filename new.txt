Update v060123

Those are the new improvements:

General improvements:
	● Fixed the bug where STMod was throwing random 'An error occured' messages;
	● Added 'Priority' at farmbot (the bot will set the priority to what you've chose: metins or bosses first);
	● Now you can ignore multiple metins at once (if you already had an ignore-metins list, please delete it >> from there: STMod folder > Resources > Servers > Server name > metins_to_ignore.txt and re-make it;
	● Added function for the bot to wait x seconds after entity died;
	● Fixed STMod for Metin2BR (Please follow the tutorial from our website, in order to work properly).
