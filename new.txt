In this version, v221021

Those are the new improvements:

● Added a checkbox to disable/enable 'stop farmbot if player near';
● Added changeable range at farmbot;
● Added changeable type and names for metins that aren't detected (on some pservers).

Please report if there are some bugs / issues, thanks!
NOTICE: Please report which server does work and which doesn't. So I could update the list.
