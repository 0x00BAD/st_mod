Update v160124


Those are the new improvements:

● Fixed STMod for Abyssus2 (use config from import settings);
● Fixed STMod for Metin2BR (use config from import settings);
● Fixed shop creator for Metin2BR;
● Fixed Switchbot for Zemia & SoW2;
● Fixed 'Item refiner' for Zemia & SoW2;
● At Antiban tab added: 'Relog each x minutes' function;
● At farmbot tab added: 'Manual VID range' ->
	using this, the bot will detect the entities around you faster, (lower VID range, bot will detect entities faster),
	for longer farming sessions (such as leaving bot overnight) better do not use manual vid range!
